This is a static site which pushes it's boundaries to expand itself to be a dynamic one. Ofcourse, this website doesn't have any sort of database and isn't hosted on a custom server, rather a [Staticman](https://staticman.net) instance as SaaS backend served on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) and the entire storage is maintained on a Github repository with no storage restrictions, and an open-source CMS to manage the site using [Netilfy CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and automatic deployments maintained using [Netlify](https://netlify.com). The Staticman provides secure and easily manageable comments with no third-party apps thus, more secure alternative.
